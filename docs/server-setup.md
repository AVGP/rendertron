## Using Rendertron with your server

Rendertron provides a web server that accepts request for rendering pages.
Usually your web application already uses a web server and you need to configure your web server to redirect requests from the desired bots and crawlers to your Rendertron server.

This can be done with every common web server but the steps differ between them.
Here are guides for some web servers:

- [nginx](./nginx)
- [express.js](./expressjs)

If you have instructions for other web servers, please consider [contributing to this page](https://github.com/googlechrome/rendertron)!
